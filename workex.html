                                <p>
                                  In my role as a Network Operation Associate at UST, I supported enterprise operations for Nokia and worked closely
                                  with stakeholders to resolve high-volume B2B technical and logistics-related issues. I handled 100+ customer and
                                  partner queries per week using Salesforce CRM and Cloud Genesis, and consistently maintained customer satisfaction
                                  above 90% while meeting SLA timelines.
                                </p>
                              
                                <p>
                                  Alongside operational support, I contributed to performance tracking and data-driven reporting. I built and
                                  maintained monthly Excel performance reports for 50+ employees across outlets, helping leadership identify
                                  productivity gaps and improve overall team performance by 12%. I also used SQL to analyze operational and
                                  interaction data to surface trends (such as call drops and escalations), which contributed to a 15% reduction in
                                  unresolved tickets and a 10% improvement in SLA compliance.
                                </p>
                              
                                <p>
                                  To reduce repetitive manual work, I automated reporting and tracking workflows using Python and advanced Excel
                                  methods. This reduced manual effort by 60%, saved approximately 6–7 hours per week, and improved reporting
                                  accuracy to 98%. I regularly shared insights and summaries with team leads to support faster decision-making and
                                  smoother daily operations.
                                </p>

                                  This role strengthened my ability to work with real operational data, automate workflows, and communicate insights
                                  clearly in a fast-paced environment. I gained hands-on experience in Salesforce CRM, SQL-based analysis,
                                  performance reporting, and balancing technical problem-solving with business priorities.

                                <p><em>October 2019 – September 2022</em></p>

                                <p>
                                  As a Junior Data Analyst at Professional Leather World, I worked with sales, inventory, and operational datasets
                                  to support daily reporting and business decisions. I cleaned, validated, and analyzed data using advanced Excel
                                  techniques (including Pivot Tables, Power Query, and lookup functions), improving overall data accuracy to above
                                  98% and making reporting more reliable for stakeholders.
                                </p>
                              
                                <p>
                                  I created dynamic dashboards and regular reporting views to help management track sales performance, returns,
                                  inventory levels, and employee metrics in near real time. I also conducted pricing and margin analysis across
                                  1,200+ products, contributing to a 3.5% improvement in gross margins and a 15% reduction in stockouts through
                                  better visibility into demand and inventory movement.
                                </p>
                              
                                <p>
                                  To streamline recurring reports, I automated weekly reporting workflows using Excel-based automation techniques,
                                  saving roughly 6 hours per week and reducing reporting errors by 70%. This improved consistency and freed up time
                                  for deeper analysis rather than manual preparation.
                                </p>

                                  This role built my foundation in practical analytics—cleaning messy data, creating reliable reports, and turning
                                  numbers into clear business insights. It also taught me the value of automation, accuracy, and consistent
                                  reporting in supporting operations and profitability.

                                <p>
                                  Across both roles, I learned how to work with real-world datasets, collaborate with cross-functional teams, and
                                  deliver measurable results through data analysis, reporting, and automation. These experiences strengthened my
                                  interest in data science and analytics and motivated me to expand my skills through projects in machine learning,
                                  dashboards, and end-to-end data solutions.
                                </p>
                              
                                <p>
                                  My future goal is to grow into a data-focused role where I can apply advanced analytics and machine learning to
                                  solve complex business problems, build scalable solutions, and support data-driven decision-making at an
                                  organizational level.
